    about_intro: "A young programmer with almost 3 years of experience, not afraid of challenges and eager to learn. The main programming language I used in my previous company was PHP, but I am no stranger to writing scripts in JavaScript or styling pages in CSS. I have experience with design patterns, including MVC, and writing readable, understandable and maintainable code in accordance with the Clean Code principles. I am also a 3rd year computer science student at DSW University. I am eager to learn new things and I am very inquisitive. As a hobby, I also create simple games in Unreal Engine and Unity.",
